# 🧵 Vault of Echoes: A High-Fantasy Memory-Touched D&D Campaign

Welcome, chronicler of forgotten truths. This is the official repository for **Vault of Echoes**, a homebrew Dungeons & Dragons 5e campaign created in collaboration with Copilot.

---

## 📚 Campaign Overview

The Vault of Echoes is a hidden Archive steeped in memory magic and red-thread seals. Players take on the roles of rogue archivists, illusion-breakers, and forgotten-name restorers in a world where truth is dangerous and history is rewritten through sacrifice.

- 🎭 Themes: Memory, identity, consequences, secrets  
- 🔍 Style: High fantasy (no sci-fi), narrative-heavy, exploration, magical realism  
- 🧵 Central Mechanic: Memory-threaded Vaults that respond to truth instead of combat

## 📖 Copilot Collaboration Tips

Use browser Copilot to:
- Continue story: _“Open the next Vault memory in Kalvi’s Codex.”_
- Clarify lore: _“What was Therren’s role in the stitching ritual?”_
- Update character sheets: _“Level up Dex to 6th and apply Vault-aligned upgrades.”_
- Rewind/replay: _“Recreate the flamebound trial from session two.”_

Copilot doesn’t yet sync directly with this repo, so copy/paste sections of markdown as needed. All campaign continuity is driven manually for now.
