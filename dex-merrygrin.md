## 🎲 Backstory: Dex “Lock Tongue” Merrygrin

### Origins in Fairhollow
Dex was born in the shadowed alleys of Fairhollow, a trade city where ambition and corruption danced arm in arm. His mother, a cheerful halfling fence with a knack for misplacing stolen goods, ran a backroom apothecary by day and a smugglers' switchpoint by night. His father? Unknown. Dex liked to say he was “the ghost of a good-for-nothing grin”—though some claim his uncanny charm has a touch of elven magic about it.

From a young age, Dex had two gifts: nimble fingers and a tongue slicker than oiled silk. He could lift a purse while reciting a poem, forge a signature in the mayor’s handwriting, or convince a city guard that he’d been the victim of theft.

As he grew, Dex became a fixture in the city’s underbelly—an enigma who wove between thieves’ guilds, confidence scams, and the occasional noble masquerade (often uninvited). But it was one job that changed everything.

### 🔥 The Job That Broke the Circle
Hired by the mysterious “Whispersong Syndicate,” Dex was tasked with cracking a vault said to contain an artifact older than the city itself. He succeeded… too well. What he found wasn’t gold, but a locked, rune-covered mirror—one that spoke in riddles and showed him glimpses of a future soaked in blood and shadows.

The Syndicate turned on him. His crew vanished. And Dex? He ran—with only the mirror shard, a guilt-ridden smirk, and a price on his head that even his charm couldn’t talk down.

### 🌑 Present Day
Now Dex travels the realm under a dozen names, taking odd jobs, heists, and marks along the way—not for wealth, but to trace the origins of the mirror and the truth behind the vision that haunts him. He's sly, morally flexible, and completely uninterested in being a hero.

But fate? Well, it’s got other plans.
