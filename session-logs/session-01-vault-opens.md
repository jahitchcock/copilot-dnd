# Session 1: Vault Opens

Dex enters the Vault of Echoes for the first time. He navigates the echo-glass trap network, deciphers runes etched in bloodlight, and retrieves the Regret Vial—an artifact formed of sealed sorrow. The Vault demands sacrifice, not might.

## The Echo-Glass Trap Network

The air is thick with the scent of damp stone and ancient secrets. As Dex steps deeper into the Vault, the echo-glass beneath his feet hums softly, resonating with each step. He recalls the warnings of the elders: "The Vault tests the unworthy with illusions of their deepest regrets."

Suddenly, the path splits into multiple directions, each way shimmering with a different hue of light. Dex knows that choosing the wrong path could trigger the traps laid out for intruders. He takes a moment to steady his breathing, focusing on the faint whispers that seem to emanate from the walls themselves.

## Runes Etched in Bloodlight

After narrowly avoiding a series of deadly traps, Dex finds himself in a chamber illuminated by an eerie red light. The source of the light is soon apparent: ancient runes, etched in what appears to be dried blood, cover the walls of the chamber.

As Dex approaches the runes, he feels a strange pull, as if the runes are calling out to him. He reaches out tentatively, his fingers brushing against the cold, hard surface. Instantly, visions flood his mind—fragments of a past life, filled with sorrow and regret. Dex gasps, stumbling back as the visions overwhelm him.

## The Regret Vial

Shaken but determined, Dex presses on, deeper into the Vault. He knows that the Regret Vial is close. This powerful artifact, capable of sealing away even the deepest sorrows, is the key to unlocking the next stage of his journey.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, Dex enters a final chamber. In the center, on a pedestal of stone, rests the Regret Vial. The vial is beautiful, yet haunting—a perfect sphere of glass filled with a swirling, dark mist.

As Dex approaches the pedestal, he hears a voice, ancient and echoing, fill the chamber. "To claim the Regret Vial, one must be willing to confront their own sorrow. Are you prepared, seeker?"

Dex nods, his heart heavy with the weight of his past. He steps forward, reaching for the Regret Vial. The moment his fingers close around the cool glass, the chamber is filled with a blinding light.

## The Sacrifice

In that moment, Dex understands the true nature of the Vault. It is not a place of treasure and glory, but a sacred space that demands sacrifice. The Regret Vial is not a reward, but a burden—a reminder of the sorrow that all must face.

As the light fades, Dex finds himself back at the entrance of the Vault, the Regret Vial in hand. He looks back, knowing that the Vault has changed him forever. The echoes of his past regrets will no longer haunt him, for he has faced them and emerged stronger.

With renewed determination, Dex steps out of the Vault of Echoes, ready to continue his journey. The world outside is bright and full of life, a stark contrast to the darkness he has just faced. But Dex is not afraid. He knows that he carries the strength of the Vault within him, and with it, he can overcome any obstacle.
