*This session file was created to restore the missing log. Content will be added based on review of adjacent sessions.*

Dex and Therren, having chosen the burning lock, find themselves before a stone dais surrounded by four doors—each a symbol of a different fate. The Vault’s runes pulse with memory and regret. Therren, haunted by his past, stands at the stitching dais, quill of ember in hand, Codex Synaptica open. Dex braces the circle with glyphs and grit, ready for whatever backlash the ritual may bring.

Kalvi’s name is rewritten into truth. Threads of red light weave around Therren as he signs her silence away, and the Vault’s magic surges. The ritual is taxing—echoes of pain and memory lash out, but Dex’s preparation holds. Kalvi’s presence stabilizes, her voice now resonant within the Truthbrand Medallion.

As the ritual ends, Dex claims the Namewoven Cloak, a Vault-forged relic, and the chamber shifts. The Archive awakens, ready to reveal its next secret.
