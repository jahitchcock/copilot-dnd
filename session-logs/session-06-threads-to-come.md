# Session 6: Threads to Come

A sealed name flickers. A door rumbles like an exhale. Dex stands cloaked in memory, medallion glowing, blades ready. The Archive awaits his decision—and its contents are watching.

Dex consults the Codex Synaptica, revealing three threads: a name half-burned (Lureth Vox), a memory unstitched, and a warning in red thread. Dex chooses to focus on Vox, reliving her betrayal and the truth of their last words. By confessing honestly, he unseals her name, opening a hidden passage deeper into the Archive.

Dex discovers a memory-thread trap and, with Kalvi’s guidance, uses the Mirror Shard to reveal a hidden bypass. He invokes Invisibility and expertly navigates the trap, entering a chamber where Vox’s half-corporeal form paces near a cracked mirror.

Dex finds a sealed Syndicate confession scroll, a memory-bound tome of rituals, Silent Ink, and a Syndicate token. He confronts Vox, demanding answers about her betrayal. She confesses her fear and regret, and Dex chooses mercy—keeping the scroll sealed and vowing to help her escape the Vault’s grasp.

With Vox’s trust gained, Dex and Vox leave the chamber, ready to face the Archive’s heart. Dex pockets the tome and token, prepared for the next thread of fate.
