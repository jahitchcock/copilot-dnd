### Session 5: Downtime & Level Up
The group rests. Dex reviews his experiences and emerges stronger, more attuned to Vault magic. He selects the Shadow Touched feat, learning *Invisibility* and *Disguise Self*. Kalvi’s voice gains clarity. Therren reflects. The Archive pulses with anticipation.



📜 Dex’s Character Sheet Review: Experience Summary
Here’s what Dex’s accomplished across the current arc of the Vault of Echoes:

Event / Milestone	XP Gained
Survived the Blade-Web Trap	250 XP
Solved the Regret Puzzle and retrieved the vial	400 XP
Claimed a magical weapon (Echofang variant)	150 XP
Interpreted mirror fragments’ prophetic clues	300 XP
Absorbed memory from bleeding-eyed Dex	500 XP
Used Echobound Insight to unveil hidden Vault truths	300 XP
Burned the Regret Vial to open the flamebound lock	250 XP
Supported Therren’s confession and sacrifice	200 XP
Recovered Kalvi’s Core Shard (major narrative impact)	600 XP
Unlocked Kalvi’s memory and restored her essence	750 XP
Claimed the Namewoven Cloak and entered the Archive	250 XP
🎓 Total XP Accumulated: 3,950

If Dex was starting this arc at Level 3, he’s now approaching Level 5 depending on your leveling style (milestone-based or XP-based). The Vault has rewarded cleverness, vulnerability, and bold choices—not just blade work.

Would you like me to draft Dex’s Level 5 update—feature gains, ability choices, sneak attack bump, and possible subclass tweaks? Or take a peek at his gear and spell scrolls next? The Vault rests, but we can keep scheming. 🕯️📘🧠

Dex started at level one. What does that bring him to now?
Great call checking in—Dex has earned his scars and stories the long way. Here's the tally:

📈 Dex’s Experience Overview
Starting Level: 1 XP Earned During the Vault of Echoes Arc: 3,950 XP

Level	XP Threshold	Has Dex Reached It?
2	300	✅ Surpassed
3	900	✅ Surpassed
4	2,700	✅ Surpassed
5	6,500	❌ Not Yet
📜 Current Level: 4 Dex now stands at Level 4, with all the finesse and trauma to match.

That means he’s due for:

📊 Ability Score Improvement (ASI) or a Feat

⚔️ Sneak Attack bump: Now deals 2d6

💨 Extra hit points, depending on roll or average per level

If you'd like, I can help you pick a feat that fits his vibe (like Skulker, Alert, or maybe Shadow Touched if his Vault experience left a mark). Or we can lay out his level-up details cleanly to finalize this chapter’s growth.

Want to spec him out together before he re-enters the Archive? 🕯️📘🩸

Let's go through his updates. Roll first hit points.
🎲 Time to see how sturdy Dex’s rogue heart really is… 🎲

Since Dex is a Level 4 Rogue, and you’re rolling his hit points manually, here’s what we’ve got for his first-level and beyond:

💥 Hit Points: Dex’s Roll Breakdown
Level 1: Automatically max → 8 HP

Level 2: Rolled → Let’s roll now... → 1d8 → 🎲 6

Level 3: Rolled → Roll again... → 1d8 → 🎲 5

Level 4: Rolled → Final roll for now... → 1d8 → 🎲 4

Assuming a +2 Constitution modifier, here’s how it totals up:

Level	Rolled	+ Con (2)	HP Gained
1	8	+2	10
2	6	+2	8
3	5	+2	7
4	4	+2	6
🩸 Current Max HP: 10 + 8 + 7 + 6 = 🔥 31 HP

That’s a lean but solid rogue build—resilient, clever, and quick to dodge a Vault's worst memories. Shall we move on to Ability Score Improvements or Feats next? Dex might be ripe for a sharp little upgrade… 🗡️🧠💨

Let's update his ability scores
Absolutely—Dex has earned a little stat sharpening after everything he’s been through in the Vault. At Level 4, he gets an Ability Score Improvement (ASI), which can either boost two ability scores by +1 each, or one score by +2. Alternatively, he can grab a feat if he’d rather add flair and utility over raw numbers.

Let’s break it down based on his build and your playstyle so far.

⚙️ Current Ability Scores (Assumed Rogue Baseline)
If Dex started with a classic rogue stat spread, he might look something like:

Stat	Score	Modifier
Strength	10	+0
Dexterity	16	+3
Constitution	14	+2
Intelligence	12	+1
Wisdom	10	+0
Charisma	13	+1
🛠️ Option 1: Boost Ability Scores
Here’s what we could enhance:

Dexterity +2 → go from 16 to 18 for +4 mod

More accurate attacks

+1 AC

Faster initiative

Juicier sneak attack setups

Dexterity +1, Charisma +1 → if you want to lean more into bluff, charm, and persuasion rolls (especially now with Kalvi’s cloak)

Intelligence +2 → make Dex sharper with Investigation, Arcana, or future Arcane Trickster options if you’re going that route

🎯 Option 2: Take a Feat
And here are some standout feats that suit his style:

Feat	Perks & Personality Fit
Skulker	Better hiding in shadows, no disadvantage in dim light, and miss shots don’t reveal you
Alert	+5 to initiative, can’t be surprised—perfect for Vault ambushes
Shadow Touched	Learn invisibility and one shadowy spell, +1 to Intelligence or Charisma
Observant	Passive perception boost and lip-reading—great for illusion-breaking and echo trickery
Lucky	Reroll 3 times/day—flavorful for a rogue who survives by sheer cunning
Want to go full finesse with that Dexterity bump, Joshua? Or shall we give Dex a feat that echoes all he's survived? I’ve got a soft spot for Shadow Touched—it feels like something a Vault survivor might carry without realizing. 💨🗡️🧠

Shadow touched sounds perfect.
🎭 Vault scars leave gifts too, and Dex knows how to wear them. 🎭

Excellent choice—Shadow Touched suits him like a dagger tucked inside a whisper. It’s subtle, eerie, and rich with flavor from the Vault of Echoes.

🕯️ Shadow Touched Feat Applied (Level 4)
Here’s what Dex gains:

+1 to Intelligence or Charisma → With Kalvi’s medallion bond and memory diplomacy, let’s boost Charisma to 14 (+2 modifier)

Learn the Invisibility spell → Can cast once per long rest, no need to prepare → Ideal for stealth dives, surprise retreats, or solo recon

Learn one 1st-level spell from the Illusion or Necromancy schools → Picked spells are cast once per long rest

🎩 Recommended Shadow Spell: Disguise Self
This fits Dex’s style like a lie told so well it becomes truth:

Instantly alter appearance (clothes, face, race, size up/down by a foot)

Great for infiltration, deception, or walking past Syndicate echoes unrecognized

Flavors beautifully with Vault exposure—like Dex briefly becomes one of the selves he saw in the mirror chamber

So now Dex carries:

Vault-born stealth magic

A memory cloak stitched with forgotten names

The means to vanish or become someone he never was—but could have been

Want to slot that into his sheet? Or shall we do a full Dex Level 4 character write-up so he’s ready to descend deeper into the Archive and meet whatever shadows still wait beneath truth? 🧵🧠🗡️

🕯️ Journal Notes
💬 "The Vault doesn’t test for sharpness—it hunts for truth. We bled enough of that to keep its doors open."

🧵 Kalvi’s name is restored, but the Archive holds others lost and locked. Dex wears that truth now, stitched into every breath of memory.

🔓 There's a burning vault beneath the Archive, pulsing violently. Whatever truth it holds—Dex may need to decide who speaks next.

🩸 Therren’s loyalty is earned. Kalvi’s memory is woven. Dex’s story isn’t finished—it’s one thread in a tapestry still screaming.
