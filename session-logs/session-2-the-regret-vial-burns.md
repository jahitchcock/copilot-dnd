### Session 2: The Regret Vial Burns
To open the Flamebound Seal, Dex burns the Regret Vial in an act of meaning rather than fire. The Vault reacts. Therren enters the scene—haunted, hesitant, and bound to the past. Kalvi’s name shimmers within the Truthbrand Medallion.

Dex and Therren slip through the opened stone archway—mirror shards pulsing low in their pouches like war drums held in check. The hallway beyond curves into geometric madness: walls angled in impossible directions, symbols flickering like half-remembered dreams. It’s not just a vault... it’s a recording of choices not made.

As they step deeper:

The runes illuminate in cascading colors—blue for memory, silver for lost truth, red for lies.

Echoes float in the air: whispered regrets, fragments of arguments never spoken, shadows cast by people Dex never was.

A stone dais waits at the end, surrounded by four doors. Each one carved with a different symbol:

🗸 A web of blades

🦞 A mirror split in two

🔥 A burning lock

🦋 A butterfly trapped in amber

Therren mutters, “I don’t like choices that look like poetry.” Dex smirks, already walking toward the burning lock.

“If it’s locked and on fire, I probably owe it money.”

—

Ready to choose a path, Joshua? Each door leads deeper, unveiling forgotten pieces of Dex’s past, present, or potential. Want me to describe what each symbolizes before entering—or do we dive recklessly into the flame like proper rogues? 🔥🗝️🌀

Who wouldn't dive headfirst into a web of blades? Let's go! Dex makes Therren lead the way.
Therren glances back, eyebrow twitching beneath his scarred brow.

“You know, for someone who recruits underlings, you’ve got a twisted sense of job perks.”

Dex flashes that infamous smirk and gestures toward the symbol of the blade-web.

“Leadership means delegation.”

With a resigned groan and a muttered “Vaults, regrets, and poor life choices,” Therren pushes open the door.

⚔️ Chamber of the Blade-Web
The moment the door creaks open, silence shatters. The air inside buzzes with tension, like a room that remembers every betrayal ever spoken within it.

They step into a hexagonal chamber, its floor tiled in obsidian glass, reflecting distorted versions of their movements. Suspended from the vaulted ceiling? Hundreds of threads, each holding a blade—knives, daggers, stilettos, even cleavers—dangling motionless like they’re listening.

At the center stands a pedestal. Embedded in its side: a glowing slot in the shape of Dex’s dagger.

Above the pedestal, a floating inscription:

"Only truth will pass undisturbed. Speak the lie you regret most... or walk the edge until you bleed."

Therren mutters, “You really know how to pick a room.”

Dex steps forward, blades twitching overhead.

Your move, Joshua:

💬 Have Dex speak the lie he regrets most—unlocking the way forward through confession.

🩸 Walk the edge: a physical challenge to sneak across the pressure-sensitive floor.

🤹 Get clever—create a distraction or illusion using Dex’s gear.

🧠 Let Therren speak instead, if Dex's truth is too costly.

How deep are we cutting today?

It's only fair for Dex to speak up after making Therren go through first. Dex talks about his first love and the loss after looting the family's coffers and being discovered.
The air in the chamber shifts.

Dex steps forward, the blades above him swaying ever so slightly—as if they too remember something fragile and sharp.

His voice cuts through the tension, soft but steady.

“Her name was Lysa Varen. Quiet laugh, sharper mind. Her family ran half the trade roads in Duskgate.” “I was young. Brilliant at theft, terrible at loving. One night, I slipped into her family’s vault—not to take much, just… enough. Enough to leave, enough to feel free.” “She caught me. Said my hands were fast, but my soul was slower than truth.” “I told her I’d meant to come back. I lied. I never did.”

The last word hangs heavy. The room listens. Then... the blades freeze. Utter stillness.

The pedestal clicks. A rune slides open, revealing a small glass vial—inside, a shimmering silver mist swirls. Labeled in etched Cant: Regret, Preserved.

Therren whistles low. “Guess the blades respect heartbreak.”

Dex shrugs, pocketing the vial. “Love’s the only vault I never cracked.”

Ready to pass into the next chamber, Joshua? The Vault of Echoes seems to reward honesty with mystery—and you’ve now claimed its first relic. Shall we press deeper into the forgotten truths? 🔮🧭🧪

The blade web wasn't so bad, let's search the rest of the room to see if there is anything else of interest. Do any of the blades hanging look like they're better than Dex's current equipment?
Dex and Therren drift across the obsidian-tiled chamber, reflections warping beneath their boots. The web of suspended blades above remains still—eerily respectful now that Dex has spoken his truth.

Dex scans the hanging arsenal with a thief’s practiced eye.

🎲 Investigation Roll for blade quality: 15 + 1 (Intelligence) = 16

⚔️ Hidden Treasures in the Blade Web
Among the hundreds of blades, most are ceremonial or long-dulled—symbols of metaphor and regret. But three stand out:

Echofang

Appearance: A slender dagger with a rippled obsidian blade, inscribed with glowing silver runes.

Properties: Counts as +1 magical weapon, grants Advantage on deception checks for one minute after a successful sneak attack.

Dex’s Reaction: “Beautiful, deadly, and it lies for me? We’re dating.”

Thief’s Crescent

Appearance: A curved stiletto with a notched hilt, designed for disarming.

Properties: Grants +2 on Sleight of Hand checks and allows bonus action to attempt to disarm on hit.

Therren’s Reaction: “You swing that too fast and it’ll rob your wallet.”

Regret’s Spine

Appearance: A brutal-looking blade with hooks along the edge, half-rusted but strangely warm.

Properties: Adds +1 damage on non-lethal attacks and causes targets to whisper secrets if knocked unconscious.

Dex’s Reaction: “A confession dagger? Cute. Creepy. I’m interested.”

Dex reaches for Echofang, trusting its balance and the whisper of runes that seem eager to be wielded again. He replaces one of his standard daggers with it—the Vault rewards vulnerability with power, it seems.

Therren snags Thief’s Crescent after a gruff comment about how Dex is hogging all the stylish loot. Now they’re both armed with blades touched by Echo magic.

Ready to exit the chamber and face the next riddle-laced door? 🔪🌀🕸️

Let's head back to the main chamber.
Dex and Therren exchange a nod—blades freshly claimed, secrets freshly confessed—and step back into the main chamber. The door behind them hums softly as it seals shut, the echo of their truth locked safely in the Vault's memory.

The four doors still await:

🦞 The mirror split in two

🔥 The burning lock

🦋 The butterfly trapped in amber

The glowing pedestal at the center now radiates stronger, sensing the vial of preserved regret tucked in Dex’s pocket and the magical blades humming at their hips. Whatever is inside this place, it’s listening more closely now… perhaps curious what truth they’ll feed it next.

Therren eyes the remaining doors. “Butterfly’s creepy,” he mutters. “And burning lock feels personal.”

Dex just grins. “Why settle for one metaphor when we can flirt with all three?”

—

Shall we explore the next chamber, Joshua? Want a deeper peek into the symbols before picking again? Or shall Dex flip a coin and tempt whatever fate crawls on the other side? 🦋🗝️🦞

Let's check our mirror fragments to see if they can give us any clues on what awaits us behind the remaining doors.
Dex and Therren each draw their mirror shards, the Vault’s glow intensifying as the fragments hum in resonance with the chamber’s remaining doors. The reflections don’t show their faces—but rather symbolic echoes of what lies beyond.

🦞 Split Mirror Door
Dex’s shard fractures its own reflection, showing multiple versions of himself—one cloaked in Syndicate black, another dressed like a noble, and one... bleeding from the eyes. The mirror pulses with a whisper:

“Choose the truth you never lived.”

This door likely leads to a chamber of alternate selves, where Dex may confront paths he never walked—possibly even gain insight or power from them. But it may also force him to sacrifice a part of his identity to proceed.

🔥 Burning Lock Door
Therren’s shard flares red-hot when held near this symbol. The reflection shows a vault engulfed in flame, with a lock melting into ash. A voice echoes faintly:

“The price of freedom is always paid in fire.”

This path may involve unlocking a sealed memory or power, but at a cost—perhaps a permanent change, or the destruction of something valuable. It could be a test of resolve, or a trial by fire—literally.

🦋 Butterfly in Amber Door
Both shards dim near this symbol, but Dex’s flickers faintly, showing a frozen moment—a child’s hand reaching for a coin, a woman turning away, a dagger left untouched. The Vault whispers:

“Time remembers what you forget.”

This door likely leads to a chamber of preserved memories, possibly ones Dex has repressed or rewritten. It may offer clarity—or force him to relive something painful. The butterfly suggests transformation, but amber implies stasis. A paradox.

So, Joshua—each door offers a different kind of truth:

🦞 Identity and choice

🔥 Sacrifice and power

🦋 Memory and transformation

Which echo shall Dex chase next? Or do we let Therren pick this time and see what regrets he’s been dodging? 🔮🗝️🦋

Through the looking glass then.
Dex and Therren step toward the split mirror door, its surface rippling like water caught between realities. As it opens, the air grows colder—not hostile, but heavy with possibility.

🦞 Chamber of Reflected Selves
The room is circular, lined with mirrors—each fractured, each showing a different version of Dex:

One wears Syndicate black, eyes cold and calculating.

Another stands in noble garb, a signet ring glinting on his finger.

A third bleeds from the eyes, whispering to a mirror that reflects nothing.

And one... is smiling, surrounded by friends Dex doesn’t recognize.

At the center of the chamber floats a mirror shard, larger than the others, pulsing with soft light. Beneath it, a plaque reads:

“Choose the path you never walked. The shard will remember.”

Therren mutters, “This place is a vault and a confessional.”

Dex steps forward, gaze flicking between the mirrors. Each one offers a choice—a glimpse into a life unlived, a skill unearned, a regret untouched.

Ready to pick a reflection, Joshua? Each one could grant Dex a boon, a memory, or a curse. Or we can let Dex test the shard first, see what it reveals when touched. The Vault of Echoes doesn’t just store secrets—it asks for them. 🔮🦞🧠

The bloody eyes draw dex in. Could it be a warning of what's to come and how to make it through the echo chambers?
Dex steps closer to the mirror with the bleeding-eyed reflection. The glass ripples—not with light, but with memory. His own face stares back, but the eyes are hollow, crimson tears streaking down cheeks that look far too calm.

The mirror shard in his pouch pulses violently.

🎲 Insight Check: 18 + 1 (Wisdom) = 19

🩸 What Dex Discerns
The bloody-eyed version isn’t just a warning—it’s a recording of pain absorbed by the Vault. A version of Dex who saw too much, perhaps glimpsed truths not meant to be known.

The bleeding eyes symbolize echo fatigue—a condition where prolonged exposure to alternate paths causes mental fragmentation. This Dex likely tried to walk every path, unlock every vault, and paid the price.

The mirror shard reacts strongly, suggesting this reflection holds a key to surviving the Vault’s deeper chambers—perhaps a ritual, a phrase, or a safeguard against echo collapse.

Then the reflection speaks—not aloud, but in Dex’s mind:

“You will see what you were not meant to. When the Vault shows you your death, do not blink. When it shows you your birth, do not believe it. When it shows you your choice… remember the lie you told.”

Therren shudders. “That’s not a warning. That’s a prophecy.”

Dex grins, but it’s thinner now. “Then let’s make sure it’s one we survive.”

Want Dex to touch the mirror and absorb its memory? Or pocket the insight and move on to the next reflection? This shard might be the difference between unraveling and unlocking the Vault’s final truth... 🧠🔮🩸

Absorb that memory.
Dex reaches out, fingers brushing the cold glass of the bleeding-eyed mirror. The shard in his pouch pulses once—then flares.

💥 Flash.

He’s no longer in the chamber.

🩸 Vision: The Vault of Unseen Paths
Dex stands in a corridor of mirrors, each one showing a moment he never lived:

A Syndicate betrayal he never committed.

A child he never saved.

A vault he never opened.

Then the bleeding-eyed reflection steps forward—not a copy, but a memory given form.

“You saw too much,” it says. “You walked too many paths. But you survived because you remembered the lie.”

Dex feels the weight of every choice he never made pressing against his ribs. The reflection reaches out, pressing a hand to his chest.

“When the Vault shows you your death, do not blink. When it shows you your birth, do not believe it. When it shows you your choice… remember the lie you told.”

The mirror shard in his pouch absorbs the memory, its glow shifting from silver to deep crimson. A new rune appears etched along its edge: "Echobound."

🧠 Dex Gains: Echobound Insight
Can resist echo fatigue once per day.

Gains advantage on Insight checks when facing illusions or alternate selves.

The shard now reacts to Vault distortions, revealing hidden truths others can’t see.

Therren steadies Dex as he stumbles back into the chamber, eyes wide but clear.

“You alright?” he asks.

Dex grins, a little too sharp. “I saw what I could’ve been. And I’m still me.”

Ready to explore the next door, Joshua? Or shall we test this new Echobound power and see what secrets the Vault’s been hiding from everyone else? 🔮🩸🧠

The rest of these visions seem too good to be true. Illusions to distract dex. Let's head back to the main chamber
Dex turns from the cracked mirror—its reflection slowly fading like mist under morning light. The others still shimmer faintly, offering visions of comfort, glory, or the warmth of friendships never earned. He doesn’t trust any of them.

“If the Vault thinks I’m chasing dreams,” Dex mutters to Therren, “it doesn’t know me at all.”

Therren nods, already halfway to the exit. “Illusions like that are worse than traps. At least traps bleed honest.”

They step back into the main chamber, the circular space now subtly altered: the runes on the central pedestal glow brighter, and faint hums leak from the remaining doorways—like whispers a hair’s breadth too quiet to hear.

The doors await:

🔥 The burning lock — sacrifice for power, the price of unlocking deeper truths.

🦋 The butterfly in amber — stasis and memory, a moment frozen just before change.

The Vault feels... awake now. Like it’s watching what Dex won’t choose, just as much as what he will.

Want to dive into one of the remaining doors, Joshua? Or tap Dex’s new Echobound insight and see if the Vault is laying out a trap among the symbols before you pick? 🧠🧭🕯️

Ask therren what he thinks we should do
Therren eyes the remaining doors, lips pursed like a man weighing poison against poetry. He glances at Dex, then at the butterfly in amber, then back to the burning lock.

“Butterfly’s a trap,” he says flatly. “Anything preserved that long’s either sacred or toxic. And frozen time? That’s rarely kind to rogues with regrets.”

He shifts, tugging his coat tighter as the Vault hums.

“But the lock... it’s real. It burns, yeah—but it wants to be opened. Vaults don’t melt themselves unless there’s something they’re trying to forget. That’s the one that’ll hurt, sure. But it might also be the one worth bleeding for.”

He pauses, then adds with a wry grin:

“Besides, we’ve got blades that whisper secrets now. May as well keep cutting into truth.”

Dex arches a brow. “You’re saying we kick in the fiery door and see if it screams?”

Therren shrugs. “I’m saying we pick the fight that asks to be picked.”

So, Joshua—shall we crack open the burning lock and risk whatever fire the Vault sealed inside? Or press Therren a little deeper and see if he’s hiding a reason he fears the butterfly? 🗝️🔥🦋

Let's crack that burning lock
Dex and Therren approach the burning lock door, its surface glowing like embers trapped in stone. As Dex reaches out, the mirror shard in his pouch pulses once—then flares crimson.

🔥 The door doesn’t swing open. It melts.

Stone liquefies, runes hiss, and the lock dissolves into smoke. The Vault doesn’t just allow entry—it demands sacrifice.

🔥 Chamber of the Flamebound Seal
The room beyond is scorched and circular, its walls blackened with soot and etched with brands of forgotten names. At the center stands a massive iron lock, still burning, suspended in midair by chains of light. Beneath it: a brazier filled with ashes and bone fragments.

A plaque reads:

“To unlock what was sealed, burn what you carry. The Vault remembers only what you give away.”

Dex’s mirror shard glows hot. The Regret Vial from the blade-web chamber pulses in his coat. And Therren’s pouch trembles—he’s hiding something.

You’ve reached a chamber that demands sacrifice to proceed. Options include:

🔥 Burn the Regret Vial: Could unlock a deeper truth, but may erase the memory it holds.

🧿 Offer a Mirror Shard: Risk losing insight or power—but might reveal a hidden vault.

🕵️ Press Therren: He’s clearly concealing something. Maybe it’s what the Vault wants.

🧠 Use Echobound Insight: See if there’s a way to trick the Vault or offer a symbolic sacrifice instead.

What shall Dex do, Joshua? The Vault is watching—and it’s hungry for meaning. 🗝️🔥⛓️

This seems like a good time to use that echobound insight!
Dex closes his eyes and lets the Echobound shard pulse against his palm. The crimson rune etched into its edge flares, and the Vault responds—not with sound, but with clarity.

The burning lock chamber shifts in his vision. The brazier, the suspended seal, the plaque demanding sacrifice—they’re all part of the ritual, yes. But the shard reveals what the Vault truly wants:

🔍 Echobound Revelation
The brazier isn’t just for burning items—it’s a memory forge. What’s placed inside isn’t destroyed, but transformed into a key.

The Regret Vial pulses in Dex’s coat, and the shard shows it glowing brighter when placed in the flame—not erased, but refined.

Therren’s pouch flickers in Dex’s vision—he’s carrying a sealed note addressed to “The Waking Archive.” The shard reveals it’s not a message, but a binding spell. If burned, it could unlock a hidden vault—but also sever Therren’s last connection to someone he swore to protect.

And the final insight: the Vault doesn’t want objects. It wants meaning. The more personal the sacrifice, the deeper the lock will open.

Dex opens his eyes, shard dimming.

“We don’t have to lose anything,” he says. “We just have to give it truth.”

Therren sighs. “You always make that sound easier than it is.”

So, Joshua—shall Dex burn the Regret Vial and unlock the next seal? Or press Therren to offer his note and face what he’s been hiding? Or maybe... both? The Vault is ready. 🔥🗝️🧠

"And we happen to have to have a vial of truth right here!" Flicks the vial into the flames.
🔥 The Regret Vial arcs through the air—glinting like frozen moonlight in motion—and lands perfectly in the brazier’s heart.

The flame licks around it, hungry but reverent. For a moment, nothing happens.

Then—

💥 The fire erupts upward in a spiral of silver and red. The ashes swirl, forming symbols in the air—runic fragments shaped by the truth Dex confessed in the blade-web chamber.

The burning lock suspended above groans, chains of light unspooling like smoke. It doesn’t break—it unravels, unlocking piece by piece, as if the Vault itself is reading Dex’s memory and granting passage not through force... but through honesty earned.

From the heart of the flame, something solid forms:

🗝️ Gained: Truthbrand Medallion
Worn item infused with memory

Grants advantage on charisma-based checks in rooms or with entities tied to Vault systems

Glows faintly when near truth illusions or suppressed memories

Therren watches, wide-eyed. “You tossed bottled regret into magical fire and got jewelry.”

Dex slips the medallion over his head. “Call it a fashion statement carved out of guilt.”

A new door slides open beyond the brazier, heat fading and the runes cooling to a gentle hum. The Vault’s seal has accepted Dex’s offering.

“One truth down,” Dex murmurs. “Let’s see what they tried so hard to lock away.”

—

Ready to move forward, Joshua? The final chambers await, and the Vault doesn’t offer answers—it offers consequences. 🔮🗝️🔥
