# 🧷 Vault Symbols & Glyph Index

## 🔣 Iconography Directory

| Symbol | Name              | Interpretation |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| 🔒     | **Memory Seal**   | Represents a truth or name locked behind guilt, confession, or sacrifice |
| 🧵     | **Red Thread**    | Connection, continuity of forgotten identity, or fate trying to reassert itself |
| 🪞     | **Mirror**        | Illusion, identity distortion, or internal conflict; often triggers self-reflection tests |
| 🕯️     | **Echo Surge**    | Emotion-laced Vault disturbances; may trigger echo backlash or memory phenomena |
| 📖     | **Codex**         | Narrative prompt, story anchor, or memory gate held by Kalvi or the Vault itself |
| 🎴     | **Reflective Rest** | Designates a safe place for internal confession, memory healing, or inspiration |
| 🔥     | **Flamebound Rune** | Indicates areas where emotional sacrifice (e.g., Regret Vial) opens sealed paths |
| 🪶     | **Whisper Glyph** | Responds to whispered names or secret confessions; activated via vocalized truths |
| 🕳️     | **Threadwell Spiral** | Deep Vault symbol representing recursion—“the story under the story”; linked to hidden Vault paths |
| 🧩     | **Stitch Mark**    | Appears during or after a successful name-stitching ritual; stabilizes identity threads |
| 🐍     | **Syndicate Sigil** | Scar or trace left by agents like Lureth Vox; stylized serpent often seen half-scorched |
| 👁️‍🗨️  | **Echo Lens**      | Magical interface for detecting illusions, truthblind glyphs, or suppressed entities |
| 🪦     | **Excised Marker** | Warns of fully erased identities—names removed beyond stitching, requires advanced restoration |
| 🛑     | **Pulse Lock**     | Stops progress until a character speaks a suppressed memory aloud; often tied to Kalvi’s Codex or medallion pulse |
| 🗝️     | **Namekey Rune**   | Rare glyph embedded in objects or memory-shards that can unlock Codex-bound names when paired correctly |

## 🧭 Usage in Game Design

- **Room labeling:** Attach symbols to doorways, floor mosaics, or glowing glyph circles to hint at function or danger.
- **Puzzles:** Combine 2–3 icons to form a visual “sentence”—e.g. 🔒🧵📖 = *A sealed name needs red thread restoration via Codex.*
- **Echo Events:** Insert 🕯️ as a reminder that something reactive may occur based on character emotion or memory state.
- **Stitching Rituals:** Add 🧩 glyphs mid-ritual to visualize progress, especially when fending off memory backlash.

## 🧾 Archive Notes

Symbols may evolve over time or change color/reactivity depending on the party’s emotional or narrative progress. The Codex Synaptica will occasionally render glyphs that match or oppose these forms—document new variations as discovered.
